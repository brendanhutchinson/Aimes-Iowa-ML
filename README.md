# Aimes-Iowa-ML
 The Ames housing dataset from Kaggle.Com contains approximatly 2,600 house sale records between 2006 and 2010.  information on house features and the sale price.
 
 
 The goal of the project is to:
 
- perform descriptive data analysis to gain insights into what is effecting home prices in Ames, IA 

- clean and organize the data to improve overall models 

- Analyze and construct new features that we believe may impact overall home price 

- Determine  which descriptive machine learning models would be optimal for predictions 

- Construct and optimize predictive machine learning models  to accurately asses house price prediction.


Feature Manipulation and Engineering 

- Turned Categorical columns to Ordinal where there was a distinct distance between each Value 
 
- Create features that aggregated Square Footage in the Homes 

- Determined Longitude and Latitude coordinates of each home and got distances 
       - From home to IA state university 
       - From home to Airport
       


Our Team Utilized 10 different machine learning algorithms 

- Multiple linear regression 
- Ridge 
- Lasso
- ELastic Net 
- RandomForest 
- Bagging 
- Gradient Descent 
- XGboost 
- CatBoost 
- SVR
